# Firebase Functions

## What are they?

Firebase functions are backend functions, triggered either via https requests or specific Firebase events (e.g. database writes). They have full ability to interact with the firebase platform and run within a nodejs environment.

## How to build and deploy

The functions are not integrated into the existing CI pipeline for automated deployment as they require
a specific config file which is not shared in the public git repository.

As such to deploy you must first populate the src/config file (available from repo admin), and then run scripts
from the main repo

Select either development or production site (always use development site first)
`npm use [default/prod]`

Deploy
`Firebase deploy --only functions`
