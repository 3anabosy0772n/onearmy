# 🌍 &nbsp; Onearmy

Welcome to One Army! We are building a new platform to help unite people to support social causes, such as [Precious Plastic](https://preciousplastic.com) (which is where this all began), [ProjectKamp](https://projectkamp.com/) or [Story Hopper](https://story-hopper.com/). A platform to connect, educate and empower our global community (65K) to solve society's greatest challenges.

## 🤖 &nbsp; Technologies

### Frontend

The platform is built in **React** and use [Mobx](https://mobx.js.org/index.html) for state management, [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/basic-types.html) for typing and consistency, and [styled-components](https://www.styled-components.com/) for reusability and component based styling.

### Backend

Our backend contains microservices in Node and is based on Firebase's Firestore to manage our database.
