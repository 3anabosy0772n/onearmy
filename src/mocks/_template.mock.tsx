/*************************************************************************************  
General Q & A

Q. What are mocks?
These are simply dummy datasets for use in development. They often mimic data that 
would be populated from the main database

Q. What does ITemplateData[] mean?
We have defined the shape of our data using ITemplateData model. The extra [] simply
means we expect an array of items all matching that data structure
(for more info see https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/basic-types.html)

Q. Isn't the data incomplete?
No, createdBy is an optional field (denoted by ? in the model)


Anything else you want to know? Add it to a git issue and so we can make the 
template even more useful
