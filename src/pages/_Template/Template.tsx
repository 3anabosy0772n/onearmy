General Q & A

Q. What are pages?
These are entry points for different urls, and contain minimal layout and data binding.
They are really only placeholders for the rest of page content, which should ideally sit
across a combination of page-specific content (in a content subfolder), common content and 
general building block components.

Q. How can I get my page to render?
The page needs to be imported into the pages/index.tsx file and attached to the router
for your desired path

Q. What are the interfaces and : I can see?
This is the core of typescript, a system that defines the exact shape data should be in.
Interfaces are defined to modal the shape of data, and then applied using : for parameters
or < > for components. You can also use 'as' to tell typescript the shape of data received
(e.g. const myData:IUserData = this.getData() as IUserData)

If you want to know more about defining interfaces
(e.g. what '?' means or how to specify advanced data types) refer to 
https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/basic-types.html

Q. What's up with @inject, @observer etc.
These are decorators that wrap otherwise longer lines of javascript code required to
handle connection to the mobx global state. 

Q. What is global state?
We have data that is persisted across the app in global 'stores' (see stores folder)
which can be read and updated throughout the app. Any data that might be used by
different sections/components should be passed through the global store to avoid lots
of messy data data sharing methods

Q. How should I be naming things?
- Page Component: PascalCase (Capital letter for all words) with 'Page' suffix
- Functions: camelCase
- Interfaces: PascalCase, starting with an 'I' to denote interface



Anything else you want to know? Add it to a git issue and so we can make the 
template even more useful
